				<h1>I'm a Full Stack Developer</h1>
				<p>
					I love technology and I enjoy figuring out how things work. I'm always
					up for challenges and find learning and solving problems exciting. I
					work well in teams and can also handle projects on my own. Besides my
					technical abilities, I find joy in expressing my creativity through
					art, animation, film, and design.
